# WordPress Starter Theme

## Overview

**WordPress Starter Theme** is a clean, well-organized, and minimalist WordPress theme designed to serve as a solid foundation for developing any custom WordPress theme. It provides a sensible directory structure and essential template files, allowing developers to quickly jumpstart their projects without being bogged down by opinionated styling or overly complex features.

The goal of this WordPress starter theme is to provide the necessary boilerplate and organizational patterns to build robust, maintainable, and scalable WordPress themes.

## Features

*   **Modern Directory Structure:** Organized for clarity and scalability.
*   **Essential Template Files:** Includes all standard WordPress templates.
*   **Modular `functions.php`:** Core functionalities are broken down into include files within the `/inc` directory for better organization.
*   **Basic Asset Enqueueing:** A starting point for managing CSS and JavaScript.
*   **Translation Ready:** Includes a `.pot` file and `languages` directory.
*   **Minimal Foundational Styling:** Intentionally unopinionated, providing a clean slate for complete design freedom.
*   **`singular.php`:** Provides a fallback for single posts and pages, promoting DRY principles.

## Getting Started

1.  **Download/Clone:** Get the theme files into your `wp-content/themes/` directory from the GitHub repository.
2.  **Rename:** The directory cloned from GitHub will likely be named `WordPress-Starter-Theme`. It's recommended to rename this to `wordpress-starter-theme` (lowercase, hyphenated for consistency with WordPress standards and the internal naming below) or your own custom theme name (e.g., `my-custom-theme`).
3.  **Update `style.css`:** Open `style.css` and update the theme header information (Theme Name, Author, URI, Description, etc.). Make sure the `Theme Name` here matches "WordPress Starter Theme" or your custom theme name.
4.  **Search & Replace:** It's crucial to personalize the theme's internal identifiers. If you've renamed the theme directory to something other than `wordpress-starter-theme`, you'll need to adjust the "search for" part of these instructions accordingly.
    *   Search for `'wordpress-starter-theme'` (default text domain) and replace it with your theme's unique text domain (e.g., `'my-custom-theme'`).
    *   Search for `WordPress_Starter_Theme` (default PHP namespace/class prefix) and replace it with your theme's unique prefix (e.g., `My_Custom_Theme`).
    *   Search for `wordpress_starter_theme_` (default function prefix) and replace it with your theme's unique function prefix (e.g., `my_custom_theme_`).
    *   Search for `WORDPRESS_STARTER_THEME_` (default constant prefix) and replace it with your theme's unique constant prefix (e.g., `MY_CUSTOM_THEME_`).
5.  **Activate:** Activate the theme through the WordPress admin panel (Appearance > Themes).
6.  **Develop:** Start building your awesome theme!

## Customization

*   **Styling:** Add your custom CSS to `/assets/css/main.css` (or your preferred stylesheet organization). Remember to enqueue it properly via `/inc/enqueue.php`.
*   **JavaScript:** Add your custom JavaScript to `/assets/js/custom-scripts.js` and enqueue it.
*   **Functionality:** Extend theme functionality by adding or modifying files in the `/inc/` directory.
*   **Templates:** Modify existing template files or add new ones according to the WordPress Template Hierarchy.
*   **Template Parts:** Create reusable content blocks in `/template-parts/` and include them using `get_template_part()`.
